# Blender_Test
Demo project for Virtual Desktop Enviroment Editor Model

The mesh with the name screen is used as a screen. All the objects need UV textures. If you make changes you want to save the Blender file but you need to export to OBJ. The settings in the Enviroment Editor are as followed:

1. test.jpg is set a background image and preview image. I just create a basic render with F12 and saved this file.

2. Model, fixed screen, dynamic lighting, are all checked and you need to point to the test.obj file.

3. After giving it a name just press create and it should load in Virtual Desktop.
